<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Hello, welcome to my page, I'm Sophie. I was born and raised in Budapest.  </p>

<p>I'm working as a system analyst in Danubius IT Solutions.</p>

<p>I love problem solving and finding ways to give a structure to processes in the workplace just like in personal life. I enjoy 
  <ul>
    <li>long walks,</li> 
    <li>learn the dance of different cultures,</li>
    <li>reading books,</li> 
    <li>disovering new countries and cultures,</li>
    <li>watching movies.</li>
  </ul>
  </p>
<p>In this picture, I'm spending some time with one of my favourite animals.</p>
